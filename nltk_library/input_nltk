Information extraction from text is an important task in text min- ing. The general goal of information extraction is to discover structured information from unstructured or semi-structured text. For example, given the following English sentence,
In 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google Inc.
we can extract the following information,
FounderOf(Larry Page, Google Inc.), FounderOf(Sergey Brin, Google Inc.), FoundedIn(Google Inc., 1998 ).
